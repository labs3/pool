# labs続 pool

the first STX mining pool!

---

## how it works (simple)

mining STX tokens is a game of numbers. in order to mine profitably, an estimated ~1BTC is required initially. many people don't have 1BTC to throw at a new miner, so i made this!

this 'pool' combines lots of people's bitcoin together to mine STX profitably. you put bitcoin in and get stx tokens out. you commit bitcoin at our site, which will then add you to the list of contributors in the smart contract.

there is a 5% fee, so we can pay for servers and hosting etc. we pay for all the transaction fees out of this too.

### the Pool続 token

when you commit your sats, we'll send an equal amount of Pool続 tokens to your stacks address. if you contribute 500,000 sats, you get 500,000 Pool続 tokens to your stacks address.

what can you do with these tokens? you can vote on decisions that we as a community might make in the future, and more importantly, you can redeem your STX rewards. this makes the pool a DAO, or Decentralised Autonomous Organisation.

after 1000 blocks (1 cycle), you'll be able to redeem your STX rewards.

### dem fees seem a lil' high

5% is sorta high for a pool. i know many people will think this is a lot and i understand that. i have the intention to make this mining pool free in the future. i don't currently have a source of income, so the fees from this will go towards my pile of stx, which i can stack to effectively live off the bitcoin rewards. after i gain enough from this pool, i'll lower the fees, potentially removing the fees all together when i can.

what's that you say? that's not very business like? oh well. i'm just nice ig

once the pool gains 100K USD worth of bitcoin, Daemon Technologies will kindly give us a bounty of 100K STX tokens. this will help along significantly. once i have enough and can live off stacking, i'll be able to devote all my time to Stacks. i'll be able to build free services for everyone, which i think will give you more value than the 5% cut i take from this.

my current roadmap is available [here on my profile](https://github.com/pxydn). this is what i plan to be doing after the pool, and the projects i plan on developing for free for all.

### bro i got trust issues

understandably. we're as transparent as possible, and automate as much as we can so there's less grey area for us to go wrong. 

once you commit bitcoin, after the cooldown, you can take your share out (if you want), even if all our servers go down. this is ensured by the smart contract and requires no manual intervention from us. 

the only trust is that we use the bitcoin to mine. basically everything else is automated and trustless through the contract

## ok but how does it *really* work
